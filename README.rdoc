== Description
A ruby web shell that has autocompletion and readline behavior. It uses
websockets, repl.js, readline.js and ripl for the shell engine.

== Install
Install the gem with:

    sudo gem install nirvana

== Usage

Your browser must have html5 websockets support.

To use, start a websocket server and open termvana in a tab

    # On a mac
    $ termvana

If you close the tab, the path to nirvana's html page is (for reopening)

    $ echo $(dirname $(gem which nirvana))/nirvana/public/index.html

To see what options nirvana takes (mostly options like ripl):

    $ nirvana -h

Once you're in the nirvana web shell, autocompletion should work better than irb's (argument
autocompletion):

    >> Bo[TAB]
    >> Bond
    >> Bond.const[TAB]
       Bond.const_defined?
       Bond.const_get
       Bond.const_missing
       Bond.const_set
       Bond.constants
    >> Bond.const_g[TAB]
    >> Bond.const_get :Ag[TAB]
    >> Bond.const_get :Agent

Also notice that a subset of readline's functionality is available.  Try C-l, C-r or C-p and they
should do what readline normally does. For more keybindings, see
{readline.js}[http://github.com/cldwalker/readline.js].

== Customize
Since nirvana uses ripl under the hood, most shell behavior is customizable with ripl plugins which
get loaded from ~/.riplrc. See {ripl}[http://github.com/cldwalker/ripl] for more.
